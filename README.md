# Foreign-Exhange-Tracker
Enable users to view changes in currency &amp; track specific currency pairs.

##### Start the application by opening the index.html file in a Live Server.

###### Limitations:
###### The application can calculate the exchange amount based on amount for any currency versus the current base currency. The base currency can be changed to another currency by entering a value into that box. 

###### The plan was to allow the user to track a specific currency using the track button and have it transferred to the right side of the screen. The user would then enter the value into any currency on the left side and see changes made in the currency on the right side.
